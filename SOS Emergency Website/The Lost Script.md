## The Lost Script

_This is the script from the unpublished YouTube video… it was such an awful idea that dropped it in the middle and made the other one. Here's what you missed (or didn't miss)._

Some days are good, some days are just 'nah…. For days in the latter category, it would be tremendously useful if we could prepare ourself a bit more. But since most of us don't have the sight… this just   isn't possible. Still… we can do our best, right?

Here's a short example how you can at least be "digitally" prepared to supply paramedics, the police or as it happens - your own gang of goons with all the essential details. That way they can come to your aid IF you were just greeted at the front door by a worst case scenario.

Let's say you're out bowling with your friends. You're in the Southern Cal Bowling League, so you have to hone your skills at some point. When you leave the bowling center there's an unpleasant surprise waiting for you at the parking lot. A gang of three nihilist tugs are waiting for you. Your flabbergasted… but not in a good way. One of your buddies tries to calm them down. The thing is, that other friend who's with you is always looking for trouble. In short:  Every thing gets out of hands pretty fast and all of a sudden you realize a strange discomfort in your chest area. Some kind of pressure, a squeezing. You recognize the shortness of breath, your arms hurt and cold sweat is running down your face. Pain. Yes indeed. That's an heart attack.

Lucky for you, one of your friends got his iPhone with him. Even better: he has this amazing app installed. The app is called Workflow. Your friend also has one of those indispensable Dropbox accounts which is linked in Workflow.

He sees you lying on the cold concrete in the parking lot of the bowling center and he doesn't hesitate a minute: he pulls out his phone and presses a button.

While the world around you gets dimmer, you silently think to yourself, that this might actually be a good thing: That dude doesn't even know what CPR stands for. He could make it all worse In case he tries to help you by beating uncontrollable at your chest. You make a mental note to thank Emmet Brown for sending this smart device back to the future.

Meanwhile on the iphone itself, your buddy selects the person whose in trouble. YOU. He Writes down a brief description of what happen on the accident location, what kind of injuries you have and gives an educated guess about your height and weight… which is - as it happens - always a valuable information for the paramedics to have. Although he made you 2 inches shorter and almost a stone lighter.

He selects your mother, wife and children as ICE contacts. But since you don't have any of those, he adds the whole Bowling League to be notified in an emergency. After he's done, he kneels down to you and says: "Don't worry Donny. I just created a slick Emergency Website for you and send out a link to all our friends. _Someone_ will send for help."

His face turns back back to his iPhone and he selects a couple of pictures from his photo library. Apparently, the website just got updated and he shows you the glaring white screen. You only hear his voice from far far away, but the soothing words ease your pain.

_"Look – it even got your mug on it, Donny; so the paramedics know who to look for. _I didn't remember you're allergic to peanuts…_ but it's here… the notes section in a vcards never lies. Whatever. Look. Here's what happened… and also where to look for us. They just need to click a button and Google Maps will open with our location. I also added some of your best friends as ICE contacts. You know the Southern Cal Bowling League is your extended family, right? You know that Donny, don't you? "I also got a sweet shot of those nihilist bastards. Maybe the police can do something about it. Good lord. My poor car. Those ignorants. By the way… WALTER! Would you mind calling 911? I'm low on battery."_
